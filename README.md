## Curie temperature Tc within random-phase approximation (RPA)

The script calculates the renormalization factor of Tc within the RPA with respect to the simple mean field approximation. 

Usage: ./rpa.py

The script expects a uniform q-point mesh (e.g. q_10.dat), the real-space lattice vectors, and the real-space positions of the magnetic atoms. 

Numpy is required.
